# Collective Intelligence

A collection of code and examples from the book, 'Programming Collective Intelligence' by Tony Segaran published by O'Reilly. 

I used this book and the code examples included in it to improve my coding ability, knowledge of python and most importantly, my statistical analysis of different sets of data. 

## Some Statistical Refreshers

**Expected Value:** Intuitively, the expected value of a random variable is the long-run 
average value of repetitions it represents of the experiment it represents. 
According to the law of large numbers, the expected value will converge to the mean as the number of repetitions increase to infinity

**Standard Deviation:** Is a measure to quantify the variation or dispersion from the mean of set of values. The lower the value, the closer the observations will be near the mean of the set of values.

**Co-variance:** The measure of joint-variability of two random variables. If covariance is +ve, the increase of one variable implies the increase of another. If negative, the increase of one variable implies the decrease of another.
