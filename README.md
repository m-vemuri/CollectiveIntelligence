# Collective Intelligence

A collection of code and examples from the book, 'Programming Collective Intelligence' by Tony Segaran published by O'Reilly. 

I used this book and the code examples to improve my coding ability, knowledge of python and most importantly, my statistical analysis of different sets of data.
